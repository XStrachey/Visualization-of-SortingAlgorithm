# Visualization-of-SortingAlgorithm

This repository is a team project assignment for the Software Integrated Development course, taken in the second year of the Software Engineering at SCUT. 

The repository contains a PC program for visualizing sorting algorithms, implemented using the QT framework. The core objective of this project is to enhance team membersâ€™ understanding and implementation of sorting algorithms, as well as to develop the ability to quickly learn and apply specific software frameworks.
